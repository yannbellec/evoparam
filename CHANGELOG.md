# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (in progress)

### Build step S5: stimulation-artifact removal with a quality score

- New module `evoparam.artifact` (spec §5.3), replacing the skeleton's `evoparam.clean`
  (removed; its interpolation is method 1 and lives in `evoparam.utils._interp`, shared with
  the legacy `utils.data.interpolate_signal`).
- `remove_artifact(ts, method=...)` returns an `ArtifactResult` (cleaned `TrialSet`, method,
  window, template or basis, per-trial quality and its components, every setting, provenance).
  Methods, each from the published equations:
  `interpolate` (linear, cubic, PCHIP); `template` (group median per site, current and
  polarity, least-squares scaled per trial and channel; `"local"` moving template of the
  nearest pulses; or a given array; masked pulses left out; warning when the template
  correlates with the response after the window; groups under 3 pulses raise, or fall back
  to interpolation); `tail` (two exponentials fitted after the window, `tau2 >= 3 tau1`,
  the decaying part subtracted; `"joint"` leaves it to the response model);
  `period_template` (fractional period by a three-stage grid search, then every sample minus
  the mean of the samples whole periods away; causal variant); `lowrank` (sequential
  regression across channels, pulses and trials); `subspace` (whitening with the baseline
  covariance, projection away from the artifact directions); `polynomial` (local cubic as a
  Savitzky-Golay filter, zeros while railed, one-sided fits after, masked until the residual
  looks like noise); `matching_pursuit` (line, response and artifact atoms; patent warning);
  `paradigm` (alternating polarity, forward masking; also `paradigm_subtract`); `learned`
  (PCA basis per group, ridge regression; basis returned); `none`.
- Masks: interpolated and zeroed samples are masked, with the existing (saturation) masks.
  Methods that subtract an estimate keep the corrected samples as measurements and do not
  mask them (a choice of this step: masking them would discard what template subtraction
  recovers).
- Quality per trial (`artifact_quality`): residual energy after the window, edge
  discontinuity, saturation fraction and template-fit r2; written to `metadata["quality"]`.
- Also: `estimate_artifact_template`, `estimate_period`, `apply_mask`, `compare_methods`
  (RRMSE and signal-to-interference ratio against a ground truth).
- Two additions to the published methods, found necessary by the tests: in `lowrank`, the
  across-channel principal-component scores are denoised across pulse segments before the
  regression (with 24 channels, raw scores inject the other channels' noise: silent-channel
  RMS +35 % instead of <= 10 %); in `tail`, the subtracted part is `r(t) - r(t_end)`, so the
  cleaned signal joins the untouched samples without a step.
- Acceptance criteria met on synthetic overlays (REQ-060 to REQ-067, REQ-069): locality and
  masks; >= 20 dB artifact reduction in the window for `template` and `learned`; period
  estimate SD below 1e-4 samples over 100 realisations and residual indistinguishable from
  the pre-stimulation noise (Wilcoxon p > 0.05) for a 130.2 Hz train with 10 and 50 Hz
  sinusoids; spike waveform correlation >= 0.95 and silent channels within 10 % for
  `lowrank`; >= 30 dB signal-to-interference improvement for `subspace`; recovery 2 ms after a
  railed pulse at 25 kHz for `polynomial`; quality AUC >= 0.9 for corrupted trials;
  alternating polarity exact to 1e-9 and the forward-masking identity; settings re-create the
  result to 1e-12.
- Not covered by this step: the latency and amplitude bias of *fitted* components after
  cleaning (REQ-061, second part) needs the fitting engine (build step S7); MEF3 data cannot
  be read yet.
- Speed (REQ-068, `benchmarks/bench_artifact.py`): 50 trials x 128 channels x 3 s at 2048 Hz
  in 0.5 to 1.3 s per method with the quality score, `subspace` 3.7 s and `lowrank` 8.6 s
  (limits 2 s and 20 s), on one core of the Mac Studio.
- The ds004080 example now subtracts a template; on that run, with a median reference and a
  window to 14 ms, the inherited fitter finds an N1 on 6 channels instead of 1. This is a
  diagnostic only: the N1 fix itself belongs to build steps S6 (referencing) and S7 (fitting
  engine).

### Build step S4: stimulation events from the raw signal

- New module `evoparam.events` (spec §5.2), replacing the skeleton's `evoparam.detect`
  (removed; `detect_stim_onsets` becomes `detect_pulses(..., method="threshold", refine=False)`).
- `detect_pulses` returns the event table of spec §4.3.4 (`onset_sample`, `onset_time`,
  `peak_abs`, `channel_argmax`, `saturated`, `n_saturated_channels`, `stim_site_guess`,
  `site_confidence`, `train_id`, `index_in_train`, `detector`, `threshold`), then `z_peak`,
  `rho`, `template_class`, `interval_flag` and, with channel names, `stim_site_pulse`.
  Steps: robust score (median over at most 16 evenly spaced channels of the absolute
  sample-to-sample change, robust z); one candidate per artifact (crossings closer than
  20 ms, or half of `min_interval`, are merged); onset at the first sample within 2 ms
  before the peak that reaches 25 % of it; strength gate (`min_relative`, 0.25 of the 90th
  percentile of the candidates' peaks); grey-zone candidates (0.4 to 1 times the gate)
  kept when their artifact repeats (`rho >= rho_min` with another candidate, ±0.5 ms
  tolerance); recovery of weaker pulses that match a confirmed template; refractory period
  in which the strongest pulse wins. `expected_rate` sets `min_interval` and the
  `interval_flag` column. `detect_events` accepts an array, a one-trial `TrialSet` or an
  MNE `Raw`; it is also `evoparam.detect_events`.
- `detect_saturation`: rail runs (2 samples with an estimated rail, 1 with a known rail) and
  stuck codes (`min_run` equal samples at least half-way to the rail), per channel and per
  pulse, plus `recovery` (5 ms); returns the mask and a table. An estimated rail must lie
  8 robust SD from the channel's median, so clean or quantised channels are never flagged.
- `identify_stim_site` (spec method: largest artifact, polarity and electrode checks,
  confidence `(a1 - a3) / a1`), with markers, triggers and auxiliary channels excluded by
  name or by channel type; `vote_sites` makes consecutive pulses agree on their site.
- `group_trains` (a new train at a site change, or at a gap longer than `max_gap`; the
  default gap is 3 times the expected or the median interval), `trains`,
  `events_to_metadata`, `match_onsets` (now with recall and precision) and
  `estimate_delay` (trigger-to-artifact delay of a system).
- Validation on OpenNeuro ds004080, 25 runs of 21 patients, 40 s each (200 pulses, 512 and
  2048 Hz): recall 0.995, precision 0.990 (REQ-040). The trigger in `events.tsv` precedes the
  first artifact sample by a constant 0.97 ms; after removing it (estimated on half of the
  runs) the median onset error is within one sample on the other runs. Stimulated site:
  agreement 0.66-0.68 with `events.tsv` (REQ-042 asks 0.95: **not met**, test marked xfail),
  but the confidence is calibrated (accuracy 1.00 on the 56 % of pulses with confidence
  >= 0.5). Cause: the amplifier holds the stimulating contacts flat or at a step, and the
  artifact reaches every contact at a similar size through the common reference.
- Mayo events (ds003708, ds004457, 6 runs): `group_trains` gives one train per block of one
  site, 10 pulses per train (median), about 0.2 Hz (REQ-044). The Mayo recordings (MEF3)
  cannot be read yet, so REQ-042 is not checked on them.
- Speed and memory (REQ-045): 10 minutes of 100 channels at 2048 Hz in 0.56 s (0.61 s with
  the site guess) on one core of the Mac Studio, 0.15 times the data size in extra memory
  (`benchmarks/bench_events.py`; opt-in test with `EVOPARAM_PERF_TESTS=1`).
- Not yet done: fractional-sample onsets for high-frequency trains need
  `artifact.estimate_period` (build step S5).

### Build step S3: component shapes and backgrounds

- `evoparam.shapes`: the eight component shapes of spec §5.5.1 (`gaussian`,
  `skewed_gaussian`, `exgaussian`, `gamma`, `biexponential`, `damped_oscillation`, `gabor`,
  `template`), unit amplitude (`max |s| = 1`), vectorised over parameter sets, with analytic
  Jacobians, default bounds from the window and the width/frequency settings, initial guesses
  and reported latencies. The Gaussian and skewed Gaussian of `core/funcs.py` are rewritten to
  this protocol; `core/funcs.py` itself is unchanged.
- `ComponentFeatures` and `compute_features`: latency, signed amplitude, polarity, FWHM,
  onset/offset (fractional peak, default 10 %), area, rise and decay times, symmetry,
  sharpness and all extrema, measured on the component curve on a grid ten times finer than
  `1/sfreq`; a latency outside the window is reported with the warning
  `"latency_outside_window"`.
- `evoparam.shapes.backgrounds`: the seven backgrounds of spec §5.5.2 (`none`, `constant`,
  `linear`, `exponential`, `double_exponential`, `pspline`, `artifact_basis`), with their
  linear basis and its Jacobian exposed for variable projection. The P-spline knot spacing
  must be at least `2 · max_fwhm` (`SettingsError` otherwise); its penalty can be chosen by
  generalised cross-validation on the baseline.
- `evoparam.shapes.registry`: `SHAPES`, `BACKGROUNDS`, `get_shape`, `get_background`, and
  `register_shape`, which checks a user shape (protocol, bounds, output shapes, unit amplitude,
  Jacobian against finite differences, initial guess, features) and raises `SettingsError`
  naming the failing check.
- Tests (REQ-100…REQ-102): every Jacobian against central finite differences on 100 random
  parameter sets inside the bounds; values against independent scalar references (in float64,
  and in mpmath at 1e-10 when mpmath is installed) and closed forms in `np.longdouble`; unit
  amplitude, latency formulas and features against closed forms.

### Build step S2: readers, remote partial reads, event harmonisation, dataset registry

Scope of this step: the readers of spec §5.1 that need no NWB or Neo support. `read_nwb`,
`read_neo`, `write_bids_derivatives` and `write_nwb` (REQ-024 and the NWB / Neo parts of
REQ-020) move to build step S17 (spec §10), with the rest of the NWB and BIDS-derivatives work.

- `evoparam.io.from_array` (2-D array → one trial, 3-D → trials) and `evoparam.io.read`, which
  dispatches on the type or extension of its input (array, MNE object, `TrialSet` / `Evoked`,
  `.vhdr`, `.edf`, BIDS folder, `.evoparam` container); NWB files and Neo objects raise
  `ReaderError` until S17.
- `evoparam.io.epoch` returns a `TrialSet`: windows `[tmin, tmax)` around the sample nearest each
  onset; trials outside the recording are dropped and `kept` is stored in the provenance step;
  overlapping epochs are kept and flagged in `metadata["overlaps_previous"]`.
- `evoparam.io.read_brainvision` (inherited return form `(data in µV, sfreq, ch_names, t0)`):
  INT_16, INT_32 and IEEE_FLOAT_32, multiplexed and vectorized, resolution per channel, every
  voltage unit converted to µV (a warning lists the converted and the non-voltage channels),
  duplicated channel names suffixed `-1`, `-2`. `read_brainvision_segment` keeps its behaviour.
- `evoparam.io.read_bids`: one run, or every matching run concatenated, from a local folder or
  remotely by HTTP byte ranges (OpenNeuro by default); `events="auto"`, `select` (dict or query),
  `picks` (names, indices or channel types); channel table from `channels.tsv` and
  `electrodes.tsv`; `provenance.source` records the data file, `bytes_read`, the byte `ranges`
  and the SHA-256 of the bytes read (the whole file for local reads), the BIDS entities and the
  dataset DOI. The ten-trial read of ds004080 (REQ-021) transfers about 9.5 MB.
- `evoparam.io.RemoteFile`: chunk cache (8 MiB chunks, 32 kept), retries after 2, 4, 8 and 16 s,
  and a whole-file download with a one-line warning when the server answers 200 instead of 206.
  `EVOPARAM_OFFLINE=1` refuses every connection; all network access is in `evoparam/io/_fetch.py`.
- `evoparam.io.harmonize_stim_events` (with `HarmonizationReport`) maps stimulation columns to
  the standard metadata columns with the unit rules of spec §10.2 ("4.0 mA", "1000 µs", "1ms",
  `n/a`, units from `events.json`, inferred units reported as `unit_inferred`, contact pairs in
  `trial_type`, polarity vocabulary); `validate_stimulation_events` (with `ValidationReport`)
  reports missing fields instead of raising; `select_stimulation_events` also accepts tables
  and a current.
- `fetch_openneuro_file` gains `sha256=`: a file that does not match is deleted and
  `ReaderError` is raised.
- Dataset registry `evoparam/io/registry.json` (schema `evoparam-registry/1`) with the 14 datasets
  of spec §5.1; `list_datasets` and `dataset_info`. Every value comes from the literature review
  (`docs/spec/LITERATURE.md`, datasets axis, and `docs/spec/GAPS.md`); values not stated there
  are null.
- `evoparam.io.read_mne` (extra `mne`) and `read_edf` / `read_events_edf` (extra `edf`) raise an
  `ImportError` naming the extra when the package is missing (REQ-025), through the new helper
  `evoparam.utils._optional.require`. Their tests are skipped when the packages are absent, and
  the two extras are not yet part of `all`.
- Tests in `evoparam/tests/io/`: mini BIDS dataset written by a fixture, local HTTP servers that
  honour or ignore `Range` (and one that fails before answering), BrainVision formats,
  harmonisation, registry. The read of the real ds004080 runs only with
  `EVOPARAM_NETWORK_TESTS=1` (pytest marker `network`).

### Build step S1: data model

- `evoparam.data.TrialSet` (trials × channels × time) and `evoparam.data.Evoked`
  (channels × time), with every invariant of spec §4.3 checked at creation: `select`, `crop`,
  `average` (mean or 20 % trimmed mean, grouped by metadata, rejected trials and masked
  samples left out, results independent of `chunk`), `convert_units`, `apply`,
  `as_evoked` / `as_trialset`, `copy`, `save` / `load` (with memory mapping).
- `evoparam.data.Provenance`: package version, source, ordered steps with settings,
  environment, random seed and data hash; every container method appends one step.
- Result dataclasses: `Component`, `GoodnessOfFit`, `ResponseFit`, `GroupFit`, `TrialFit`,
  `HierarchicalFit`, `ResponseTest`, `ArtifactResult`, `ShapeBasis`, `TFFit`; NaN-aware
  equality; tidy tables with units for `ResponseFit` and `GroupFit`.
- The `.evoparam` container (directory or zip): manifest with schema version and SHA-256 of
  every file, strict JSON (NaN written as null), arrays in npz/npy, tables in parquet or CSV
  with a sidecar of dtypes and units; a newer schema major raises `EvoparamVersionError`.
- `evoparam.errors`: the error hierarchy of spec §4.6. The inherited error classes now derive
  from `EvoparamError`.
- Test of the import graph against the dependency table of spec §4.2.


First skeleton of evoparam, derived from ERPparam (see NOTICE).

- Package layout in four blocks: `io`, `detect`, `clean`, `param`.
- `io`: BIDS events reader, BrainVision reader (local or remote, partial reads), epoching,
  OpenNeuro file helpers.
- `detect`: robust-threshold detection of stimulation onsets, and onset matching.
- `clean`: artifact interpolation for arrays of any shape.
- `param`: `fit_epochs`, which fits the peak model on the average response of each channel.
- Example on public data: `examples/ccep_pipeline.py` (OpenNeuro ds004080).
- Packaging moved to `pyproject.toml`; Python 3.10 or later.
- Fixed: plotting used a missing attribute; interpolation failed on 2d arrays and used a
  sample inside the interpolated window; tests depended on run order; a debug print.
- Removed: all material specific to power-spectrum fitting.
